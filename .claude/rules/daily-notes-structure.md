# Daily Notes Structure

Standard folder hierarchy and file conventions for daily work documentation.

## When to Use

Attach this rule when:
- Starting a new day (morning kickoff creates structure)
- Creating notes for a feature, bug, or research
- Organizing existing notes
- Looking up where things should go

# Nathan's Fetch AI Workspace Rules

**Mission:** Solve 10+ problems per day across platform (Django) and clients (Next.js/React Native).

**Workspace Structure:**

- `clients/` - Frontend apps (fetch-llm, native, asi-one-native, agent-registry, web, business)
- `platform/` - Django backend with FastAPI, LangGraph, Celery
- `daily-notes/` - Structured notes by year/month/week/day
- `workspace-claude-rules/` - This consolidated rule set (single source of truth)
